      As political tensions rose in India in the early 20th century, some Indian leaders came to re-work their earlier stances on Shivaji's role. Jawaharlal
       Nehru had in 1934 noted "Some of the Shivaji's deeds, like the treacherous killing of the Bijapur general, lower him greatly in our estimation."
       Following a public outcry from Pune intellectuals, Congress leader T. R. Deogirikar noted that Nehru had admitted he was wrong regarding Shivaji,
        and now endorsed Shivaji as a great nationalist.
    In 1966, the Shiv Sena (Army of Shivaji) party was formed to promote the interests of Marathi speaking people in the face of migration to Maharashtra
     from other parts of India, and the accompanying loss of power for locals. His image adorns literature, propaganda and icons of the party.

    In modern times, Shivaji is considered as a national hero in India, especially in the state of Maharashtra, where he remains arguably the greatest figure
     in the state's history. Stories of his life form an integral part of the upbringing and identity of the Marathi people. Further, he is also
     recognised as a warrior legend, who sowed the seeds of Indian independence.[188] Shivaji is upheld as an example by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya
      Janata Party, and also of the Maratha caste dominated Congress parties in Maharashtra, such as the Indira Congress and the Nationalist Congress
       Party.[189] Past Congress party leaders in the state, such as Yashwantrao Chavan, were considered political descendants of Shivaji.
      In the late 20th century, Babasaheb Purandare became one of the most significant artists in portraying Shivaji in his writings, leading him to be
       declared in 1964 as the Shiv-Shahir ("Bard of Shivaji").[191][192] However, Purandare, a Brahmin, was also accused of over-emphasising the
        influence of Brahmin gurus on Shivaji,[189] and his Maharashtra Bhushan award ceremony in 2015 was protested by those claiming he had defamed
         Shivaji.
