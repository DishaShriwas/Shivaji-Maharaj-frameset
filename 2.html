      Shivaji was born on 1 March 1630, which corresponds to 19 February 1630 of the Julian calendar. The British records in India used the Julian calendar
       until 1752 CE, when it was replaced by the Gregorian calendar; as a result, several historical records and books mention his birthdate as 19
       February instead of 1 March.[5] Historically, there was some debate about this date, because the Jedhe chronology - records maintained by the
       Jedhe family, whose ancestors served as Deshmukhs of Kari - places Shivaji's birth in 1627. However, the 1630 date is corroborated by a copy of his
        birth horoscope found in Rajasthan,[2] and a poem composed by his courtier Parmanand.
      Shiva-Bharata, a poem by Shivaji's court poet Paramananda, presents Shivaji as a divine incarnation, stating that the god Vishnu visited Jijabai in
       a dream, and then "a portion" of Vishnu entered her womb as Shivaji.The poem also claims that during her pregnancy, Jijabai had cravings
       indicative of a child with royal and martial characteristics, such as to sit on a golden throne and to lead men to battle victories.
       Shivaji's father Shahji belonged to the Bhonsle clan, which claimed patrilineal descent from the Sisodia Rajput royal family of Mewar.
       His mother Jijabai came from the aristocratic Jadhav family, which traced its lineage to the Yadavas of Devagiri.
       Shivaji's royal priest Gaga Bhatta presented him as a member of the Kshatriya solar dynasty, counting the Sisodia Rajputs among his ancestors.
        The claim is also supported by Shiva-Bharata, a text composed at Shivaji's court.
