      The question of Shivaji's heir-apparent was complicated. Shivaji confined his son to Panhala in 1678, only to have the prince escape with his wife
      and defect to the Mughals for a year. Sambhaji then returned home, unrepentant, and was again confined to Panhala.
  Shivaji died around 3–5 April 1680 at the age of 50,[126] on the eve of Hanuman Jayanti. The cause of Shivaji's death is disputed. British records
  states that Shivaji dead of bloody flux being sick for 12 days.[f] In a contemporary work in Portuguese, the Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa, the recorded
   cause of death of Shivaji is anthrax.[128][129] However, Krishnaji Anant Sabhasad, author of Sabhasad Bakhar, the biography of Shivaji has mentioned
    fever as the cause of death of Shivaji.[130][129] Putalabai, the childless eldest of the surviving wives of Shivaji committed sati by jumping into
    his funeral pyre. Another surviving spouse, Sakwarbai, was not allowed to follow suit because she had a young daughter. There were also allegations,
     though doubted by later scholars, that his second wife Soyarabai had poisoned him in order to put her 10-year-old son Rajaram on the throne.

  After Shivaji's death, Soyarabai made plans with various ministers of the administration to crown her son Rajaram rather than her stepson Sambhaji.
  On 21 April 1680, ten-year-old Rajaram was installed on the throne. However, Sambhaji took possession of Raigad Fort after killing the commander, and
   on 18 June acquired control of Raigad, and formally ascended the throne on 20 July.[132] Rajaram, his wife Janki Bai, and mother Soyrabai were
   imprisoned, and Soyrabai executed on charges of conspiracy that October.
