  Shivaji was well known for his strong religious and warrior code of ethics and exemplary character.[169] He was recognized as a great national hero
   during the Indian Independence Movement.While some accounts of Shivaji state that he was greatly influenced by the Brahmin guru Samarth Ramdas,
    others have said that Ramdas' role has been over-emphasised by later Brahmin commentators to enhance their position
    Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the Sultanate of Golkonda, Sultanate of Bijapur and
     the European colonial powers. Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha
      navy. Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations. He revived ancient Hindu
      political traditions, court conventions and promoted the usage of the Marathi and Sanskrit languages, replacing Persian in court and administration.
      Shivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but nearly two centuries after his death, he began to take on increased importance with the
      emergence of the Indian independence movement, as many Indian nationalists elevated him as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.
