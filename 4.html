      Mughal conflicts refer to the period between the first Mughal attack on the Ahom kingdom in 1615 and the final Battle of Itakhuli in 1682.
      The intervening period saw the fluctuating fortunes of both powers and the end of the rule of Koch Hajo.
       It ended with the Ahom influence extended to the Manas river which remained the western boundary of the kingdom till the advent of the British in
        1826.
        From the time the Mughals appeared in the north-eastern frontier, a state of indirect rivalry and hostility began between the Mughals and the
        Ahoms. After the final defeat of Parikshit (1613) the first organised Mughal attack upon Assam was made with a view to conquer that kingdom.
         It was the outcome of the aggressive imperialism of the Mughals. "A desire for political supremacy and territorial expansion appears to have
         been the guiding motives of the Mughals." Boundary disputes and the trade rivalries appear to have complicated the situation and political
         issues precipitated the conflict. After the extinction of the Kamrup monarchy, the Mughals came to regard the territory east of Barnadi up to
         Singiri as part of the conquered region and hence asserted their political right over it. Ahoms strongly resented this claim. "Moreover the rich
         natural resources of the Assam valley and the prosperous kingdom of Kamrup in lower Brahmaputra valley, abounding in elephants and aromatic
         plants excited the cupidity of the Mughals and they were determined to force open the door of Assam.
